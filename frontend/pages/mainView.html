                            Smart Solutions, the owner of this webshop, has a passion for classic computers. He gained his first computer experience as a kid with Windows 3.11 and MS-DOS back in the 90's. Years ago he discovered the 'strange' (it's not a pc..) MSX-2 from his dad and in 2003 he bought a Commodore 64C in a thrift store. Since then he has collected, restored and used many classic computers, also including classic game consoles. He had the wish to own more different kinds of classic computers for his collection though his storage space and funds were limited. Therefore he had to make choices, hence he started selling sometimes. He began once on eBay in 2005 and quickly expanded his eBay webshop. By offering classic computers to an international market, enthusiasts from other countries can also enjoy retro gaming, programming, repair, service and design of these wonderful tech 'collectables' from another era. He finds it important that these classic computers can be re-used or re-cycled for parts, to reduce the massive piles of e-waste worldwide.
